# Evaluation of Free LLM Models for VALORANT Digital Assistant

The VCT project involves building a digital assistant powered by large language models (LLMs) to assist with explaining the gameplay, mechanics, and strategies of the game **VALORANT**. The following document compares several free-to-use LLM models to help decide which one best fits the needs of this project. The model should be capable of providing text-based responses, answering user questions, and handling domain-specific content related to esports and games.

## LLMs Evaluated

The following LLMs are freely available and have been taken into consideration for this project:

### 1. GPT-Neo (EleutherAI)

- **Description**: GPT-Neo is an open-source implementation of a GPT-like language model developed by EleutherAI. It is a popular alternative to OpenAI's GPT models and supports text generation based on large amounts of internet text data.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **Model Sizes**: Available in two versions: 1.3 billion and 2.7 billion parameters.
  - **Training**: Pretrained on diverse text corpora from various domains, making it versatile for general use and adaptable for domain-specific tasks (like esports).
  - **Performance**: Generates fluent and coherent responses but may require fine-tuning for highly specialized or niche content like VALORANT strategies or agent mechanics.
  - **License**: Apache 2.0 (Free for commercial and non-commercial use).
  
- **Why Consider for VALORANT?**:
  - GPT-Neo is robust and can handle large amounts of context, making it suitable for providing detailed game mechanics explanations or answering in-game queries.
  - It can be fine-tuned further to understand VALORANT-specific terminology and gameplay.
  
- **Challenges**:
  - While it handles general text well, the absence of game-specific training means it might struggle with very detailed esports or VALORANT-specific questions without fine-tuning.

### 2. BLOOM (BigScience)

- **Description**: BLOOM is a multilingual, large-scale model developed by the **BigScience** project. It is designed to handle over 46 natural languages, making it especially useful for projects targeting global audiences or multilingual environments like Singapore.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Model Sizes**: Available from 560 million parameters up to 176 billion parameters.
  - **Multilingual**: It can generate responses in English, Chinese, and several Southeast Asian languages, including Malay, Tamil, and others spoken in Singapore.
  - **Performance**: High-quality text generation across multiple domains, with particular strengths in generating multilingual content and general knowledge. It can handle Singapore's multi-language context well.
  - **License**: RAIL License (allows free use with limitations, such as avoiding harmful use).
  
- **Why Consider for VALORANT?**:
  - BLOOM’s ability to understand multiple languages makes it perfect for multilingual content in Singapore’s gaming scene, where players might speak English, Chinese, or Malay.
  - Its multilingual capacity allows more flexibility if the assistant needs to answer questions in different languages.
  
- **Challenges**:
  - The larger model sizes (176B) require significant computational power, which may not be ideal for deployment without high resources.
  - May not be as specific to gaming or esports unless fine-tuned with game-specific data.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Model Size**: 124 million parameters (about 60% smaller and faster than GPT-2).
  - **Training**: Pretrained on a similar text corpus to GPT-2, but distilled for efficiency. It’s optimized for generating coherent text responses without heavy computational demand.
  - **Performance**: While smaller, it can still generate decent quality text. However, it lacks the depth and nuance of larger models like GPT-J or GPT-Neo.
  - **License**: MIT License (Free to use).
  
- **Why Consider for VALORANT?**:
  - If your goal is quick responses and low-latency text generation, DistilGPT-2 can handle basic conversations about the game.
  - Suitable for simpler or less resource-intensive tasks, such as basic game explanations or answering straightforward questions.

- **Challenges**:
  - Its smaller size means it may struggle with more complex or detailed VALORANT-specific queries.
  - Limited ability to provide deep insights or handle lengthy responses without losing coherence.

### 5. Flan-T5 (Google)

- **Description**: Flan-T5 is a powerful, instruction-tuned model developed by Google that excels at generating responses for task-based requests. It's fine-tuned on instruction-based datasets, making it great for handling complex instructions or detailed requests.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Model Sizes**: Available in various sizes (Small, Base, Large, XL, XXL).
  - **Training**: Tuned specifically for tasks involving instructions or multiple-step responses, making it ideal for assisting users with detailed or procedural queries.
  - **Performance**: Flan-T5 excels at understanding nuanced instructions and generating precise responses, which could make it ideal for explaining game mechanics, agent strategies, and advanced techniques in VALORANT.
  - **License**: Apache 2.0 (Free to use).

- **Why Consider for VALORANT?**:
  - **Instruction-tuning** makes Flan-T5 great for handling specific instructions (e.g., "Explain how to use Jett's abilities in a 1v1 scenario").
  - Works well for detailed game breakdowns, providing step-by-step guidance and explanations.
  
- **Challenges**:
  - May require additional fine-tuning for better domain-specific knowledge of VALORANT, but its instruction-following nature makes it a strong candidate.

- **For General-Purpose Use**: 
    - **GPT-Neo** and **GPT-J** are strong general-purpose models. They are both open-source and can handle a wide range of tasks with good text generation capabilities. If you're focusing on fluency, coherence, and general knowledge of the game, these models are great starting points.
  
- **For Multilingual Support in Singapore**: 
  - **BLOOM** is ideal due to its multilingual capabilities. If your target audience includes users who speak Malay, Tamil, or Chinese (common in Singapore), this model will provide the flexibility to handle multiple languages.

- **For Fast and Lightweight Deployment**:
  - **DistilGPT-2** is your go-to option for low-resource or fast response systems. Although it sacrifices some depth, it is sufficient for handling simpler, quick-response tasks, such as explaining basic game mechanics or answering casual queries.

- **For Instruction-Tuned Applications**:
  - **Flan-T5** is excellent for more structured responses and tasks that require following specific instructions. It's ideal for explaining complex in-game scenarios, providing step-by-step guides for VALORANT agents, or advanced mechanics.

### Recommended Path Forward

For the **VALORANT digital assistant** project:
- If you require deep game-specific analysis, consider **GPT-J** for its balance of size and efficiency.
- If multilingual support is a priority, especially in the **Singaporean context**, **BLOOM** would be a top choice.
- For specific, instruction-based responses (e.g., explaining strategies in VALORANT), **Flan-T5** is highly recommended.

Additionally, some models like **GPT-Neo** and **GPT-J** can be **fine-tuned** on domain-specific data (such as VALORANT esports data) to improve their ability to answer detailed, game-related queries accurately.
