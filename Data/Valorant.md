## 2. Core Game Mechanics

The game involves several core mechanics that are vital for understanding how to play and strategize effectively.

- **Rounds and Economy**: Each match is divided into rounds where players earn in-game currency based on their performance. This currency is used to buy weapons, shields, and abilities.
  
- **Agent Abilities**: Each player selects an agent with a unique set of abilities, including offensive, defensive, or supportive powers. These abilities are as crucial as weaponry for winning rounds.

- **Weapons**: VALORANT offers a variety of weapons, including pistols, rifles, shotguns, and snipers. Each weapon has its own damage profile and recoil pattern.

- **Rounds**: The round starts with a "buy phase" where players purchase equipment. Attackers must plant the spike, and defenders must prevent the plant or defuse the spike if it is planted.
