## Role Definitions

### Agent Roles:
1. **Duelist**: Focuses on aggressive playstyles and initiating combat with the aim of securing kills.
2. **Controller**: Specializes in manipulating the battlefield by blocking sightlines and controlling map areas.
3. **Initiator**: Supports the team by gathering information, disrupting enemies, and creating opportunities to push.
4. **Sentinel**: Focuses on defense, locking down areas of the map, and providing utility for teammates.

### Team Roles:
- **In-game Leader (IGL)**: The player responsible for calling strategies, managing the team's overall approach, and adapting to the enemy.
- **Support**: Players who provide crucial utility, healing, or defensive capabilities to help the team succeed.
- **Fragger**: The player who focuses on securing kills, often taking on the Duelist or aggressive roles.
- **Flex**: A versatile player who can adapt to multiple roles based on the team's needs, switching between Duelist, Support, or other roles as necessary.
- **Lurker**: Operates independently from the rest of the team, often playing stealthily to gather information, flank enemies, or disrupt the opposing team’s plans.

### Flexibility of Team Roles

In VALORANT, team roles are not set in stone and can vary significantly depending on team strategies. While traditional roles such as **Lurker** or **Fragger** are often associated with specific agent classes (e.g., **Sentinels** for Lurkers, **Duelists** for Fraggers), these roles are flexible.

For example:
- Some teams may opt to **forgo a dedicated Lurker**, choosing instead to adopt more aggressive or cohesive team strategies that don’t rely on a player operating independently. In these cases, teams might use other roles more dynamically to adapt to their opponents.
- **Fragger roles**, typically associated with **Duelists**, may sometimes be filled by agents from other classes. For instance, a player who usually plays a Duelist could pick **Sage** (a Sentinel) and still fulfill the Fragger role by using aggressive positioning and gunplay. This highlights the adaptability of players within teams.

Ultimately, team compositions and roles are influenced by a combination of the agents available, the map being played, and the overall strategy. Players often switch roles to maximize team cohesion and effectiveness, showing that flexibility is key to success in competitive play.
